# 🌐 Web App With AI

Now we upgrade your web app.

Instead of just showing text,
it will behave like a small AI assistant.

The AI will:
- respond to "hello"
- tell the time
- do simple math
- handle unknown commands

All inside the browser.

No server required.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Open:

project/index.html

Double-click it to open in your browser.

## 🎯 What You Will Build

Example:

Type:
hello  
→ It replies: Hello there!

Type:
time  
→ It shows current time

Type:
add 5 7  
→ It shows 12

This is your first browser-based AI.
