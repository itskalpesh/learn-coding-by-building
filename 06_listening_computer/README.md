In the last lesson, the computer learned to speak.

Now it will listen.

You will speak into your microphone,
and the computer will convert your voice into text.

This is called **Speech-to-Text (STT)**.

---

## 🧰 One-Time Setup

Install required libraries:

```

pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyaudio

```

⚠️ If PyAudio fails on Windows, try:

```

pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio

```

---

## ▶️ Run the Program

Go to the `project/` folder and run:

```

python main.py

````

When prompted:
- Speak clearly
- Wait a moment
- See your words appear as text

---

## 🧠 Read the Code

Open `project/main.py`.

---

### Step 1 — Import Library

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
````

This loads the speech recognition system.

---

### Step 2 — Create Recognizer

```python
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
```

This prepares the system to process sound.

---

### Step 3 — Use Microphone

```python
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Listening...")
    audio = recognizer.listen(source)
```

* The microphone records your voice
* The audio is stored in a variable

---

### Step 4 — Convert Speech to Text

```python
text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
print("You said:", text)
```

This sends the audio to Google’s speech recognition service
and returns the text.
