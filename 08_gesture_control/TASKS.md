# 🧪 Tasks — Gesture Control

---

## ✅ Task 1: Count Fingers

Detect how many fingers are raised.

Display:
"Fingers: X"

(Hint: Compare landmark positions.)

---

## ✅ Task 2: Thumbs Up Detection

Detect if only the thumb is up.

Print:
"Thumbs Up!"

---

## ✅ Task 3: Gesture to Action

If 5 fingers are up:
Print:
"Stop Program Soon"

You can later connect this to:
- exit program
- pause detection

## 🏁 Success Check

You are done when:
- Hand landmarks are visible
- Finger count works
- At least one gesture triggers a message
