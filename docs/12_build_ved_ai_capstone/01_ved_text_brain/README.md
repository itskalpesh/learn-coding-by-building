# 🤖 01. VED Text Brain

This is the foundation of VED.

You are no longer building small experiments.

You are building a structured AI assistant.

This first step creates:

- A command loop
- A router (decision system)
- Modular functions
- Clean architecture

No voice.
No vision.
Just logic.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Build

Example:

You: hello  
VED: Hello, I am VED.

You: time  
VED: Current time is 14:30

You: add 5 7  
VED: 12

You: exit  
VED: Goodbye.

## 🧠 Architecture

In this step:

main.py contains:

- Input loop
- Router
- Function calls

Later:
- Memory will be separated
- Tools will be separated
- Voice and vision will be added

But this is the core.

## ▶️ Run the Program

Go to:

project/

Run:

python main.py

---

## 🧠 What You Learn

- Structured AI entry point
- Clean routing logic
- Foundation for modular system
- Capstone-level organization
