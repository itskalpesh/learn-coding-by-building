# 🖥️ 06. VED UI

Now we build a simple graphical interface for VED.

This module will:

- Display a window
- Accept user input
- Show VED responses

UI does not contain AI logic.

It only calls the brain.

## 🎯 What You Will Build

A window with:

- Input field
- Submit button
- Output area

Later, we will connect this to:

- Brain
- Memory
- Tools
- Voice
- Vision

## 🧠 Why Separate UI?

If UI contains logic:

- Code becomes messy
- Hard to upgrade
- Hard to switch to web version

Separation keeps architecture clean.
