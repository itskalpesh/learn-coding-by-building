# 01. From Projects to Systems

You built many small programs.

Each one worked alone.

But real AI systems are made of parts working together.

Example:

Calculator → becomes a tool  
Memory program → becomes AI memory  
Voice system → becomes input layer  
Vision system → becomes perception layer  

This is how systems are formed.

## 🧠 Key Idea

A system is:

Input → Processing → Output

All your previous projects fit into this structure.
