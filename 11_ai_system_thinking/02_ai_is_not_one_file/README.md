# 02. AI Is Not One File

When beginners think of AI,
they imagine one big magical file.

That is not how real systems work.

Real AI systems are modular.

They are built from parts.

---

## 🧠 Imagine This

Instead of:

ai.py  (5000 lines)

We build:

- brain.py
- memory.py
- tools.py
- voice.py
- vision.py
- ui.py

Each file has one responsibility.

This makes systems:
- easier to understand
- easier to debug
- easier to upgrade

---

## 🧩 Why This Matters

You already built:

- A calculator
- A memory program
- A voice system
- A vision system
- A smart command router

Those should NOT live in one file.

They should become modules.

## 🏗️ Simple Architecture Example

User Input  
↓  
Brain decides  
↓  
Tool executes  
↓  
Output returns  

This is clean structure.

## 🧠 Key Idea

Good AI systems follow:

Single Responsibility Principle.

Each part does ONE job well.
