# 03. Core Parts of AI

Now that you understand AI should not be one file,
let’s define the main parts of a real AI assistant.

Every serious AI system has layers.

---

## 🧠 The 5 Core Parts

### 1️⃣ Input Layer

This is how the AI receives information.

Examples:
- Text input
- Voice input
- Camera input
- Gesture input

You already built:
- Listening Computer
- Seeing Computer
- Gesture Control

---

### 2️⃣ Brain (Decision Layer)

This part:
- understands commands
- decides what to do
- routes tasks

You built this in:
Smart AI Brain

---

### 3️⃣ Tools (Action Layer)

These are small programs that do specific jobs.

Examples:
- Calculator
- Time checker
- File reader

Tools perform actions.
The brain decides when to call them.

---

### 4️⃣ Memory

Stores and retrieves information.

Example:
Remembering Things project.

Without memory, AI forgets everything.

---

### 5️⃣ Output Layer

How AI responds:

- Text
- Speech
- GUI output

You built:
- Talking Computer
- Desktop App
- Web App

---

## 🏗️ Full Flow Example

User speaks  
↓  
Voice system converts to text  
↓  
Brain understands command  
↓  
Tool executes  
↓  
Output speaks result  

That is a complete AI flow.

---

## 🧠 Key Idea

AI is not magic.

It is:
Input → Brain → Tools → Output  
With Memory connected.
