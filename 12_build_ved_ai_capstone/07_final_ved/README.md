# 🤖 07. Final VED

Now we integrate everything.

VED will:

- Accept input from UI
- Process commands in brain
- Use tools when needed
- Store data in memory
- Speak responses
- Optionally use vision

This is the complete system.

## 🧠 Architecture

UI → Brain → Tools  
            ↓

Everything is modular.
