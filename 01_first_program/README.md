# 🟢 01. Your First Program

Welcome to your **first real program** 🎉  
You don’t need to know anything before this.

In this lesson, you will:
- make the computer talk to you
- type something
- see the computer reply back

That’s already programming.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Build

When you run the program, this will happen:

```

Computer: Hello! What is your name?
You: Kalpesh
Computer: Nice to meet you, Kalpesh!

```

Simple. Friendly. Powerful.

---

## ▶️ Run the Program First (Important)

1. Open the `project/` folder
2. Run this command:

```

python main.py

````

If it works — congratulations 🎉  
You are officially programming.

---

## 🧠 Now Read the Code (Slowly)

Open `project/main.py`.

### Line 1
```python
print("Hello! What is your name?")
```

This line tells the computer to **show a message** on the screen.

---

### Line 2

```python
name = input()
```

This line tells the computer to:

* wait for the user to type something
* remember what was typed

The computer stores it as `name`.

Don’t worry about the word *variable* yet.

---

### Line 3

```python
print("Nice to meet you,", name)
```

This line:

* uses what the user typed
* prints it back in a friendly way

The computer is now responding to **you**.

---

## 🧠 What You Learned (Without Memorizing)

* how to show text on the screen
* how to take input from the user
* how the computer remembers information

That’s already a lot 👍

## 📝 Practice Time

👉 Go to: [TASKS.md](/01_first_program/TASKS.md)

Try the tasks.
Breaking the code is allowed 😄
